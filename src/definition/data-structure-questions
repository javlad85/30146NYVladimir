Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. Using data structure enables a computer system to perform its task more efficiently,
by influencing the ability of computer to store and retrieve data from any location in its memory.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
-Insertion
-Deletion
-Searching
-Sorting
-Merging.



List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Compiler Design,
Operating System,
Database Management System,
Statistical analysis package,
Numerical Analysis,
Graphics,
Artificial Intelligence,
Simulation.


what is an Array?
This is a container that holds data of the same type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
ArrayList is a variable length Collection class.And ArrayList can contains Object.


what is LinkedList?
Similar to arrays in Java, LinkedList is a linear data structure.


How is an Array different from Linked List?
1-LinkedList elements are not stored in contiguous locations like arrays, they are linked with each other using pointers.
Each element of the LinkedList has the reference(address/pointer) to the next element of the LinkedList.
2-n an array, memory is assigned during compile time while in a Linked list it is allocated during execution or runtime.

what is queue?
A queue is a first-in first-out (FIFO) abstract data type that is heavily used in programming.


what is stack?
A Stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure.


what is FIFO and LIFO?
-FIFO is an abbreviation for first in, first out.
-LIFO is an abbreviation for Last in, first out is same as fist in, last out (FILO).


what is the order of complexity?
Time Complexity measures the time taken for running an algorithm and it is commonly used
to count the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm to improve the performance.



what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Binary or Logarithmic Search is one of the most commonly used search algorithms primarily due to its quick search time.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?


what is tree in data structure?
A Tree is a non-linear data structure where data objects are organized in terms of hierarchical relationship.

what is graph in data structure?
A graph is a data structure for storing connected data like a network of people on a social media platform.


what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashTable doesn’t allow null and HashMap does
Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
???


How HashMap works in java?
Hashing is a process of converting an object into integer form by using the method hashCode().
Its necessary to write hashCode() method properly for better performance of HashMap.
this is a way to assigning a unique code for any variable/object after applying any formula/algorithm on its properties.
Hash function should return the same hash code each and every time when the function is applied on same or equal objects.
In other words, two equal objects must produce the same hash code consistently.



What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
-ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are trying to access array
 element with an illegal index.
 -This exception is thrown when the index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.


What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
1-Ensure that the two arrays have the same rank (number of dimensions) and compatible element data types.
2-Use a standard assignment statement to assign the source array to the destination array. Do not follow either
array name with parentheses.


What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Array is a collection of elements of similar data type. Linked List is an ordered collection of elements of same type,
 which are connected to each other using pointers.


What is DFS and BFS?
DFS stands for Depth First Search. 2. BFS(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data structure
for finding the shortest path. ...



What is Recursion?
Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a method calls itself to solve some problem.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
-In the linear data structure, the data is organized in a linear order in which elements are linked one after the other.
-Examples of the linear data structure are array, queue, stack, linked list, etc. In contrast, tree and graph are the examples of the non-linear data structure.


What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Algorithm	Time Complexity
  Best	Average	Worst
Selection Sort	Ω(n^2)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
Bubble Sort	Ω(n)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
Insertion Sort	Ω(n)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
Heap Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
Quick Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n^2)
Merge Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
Bucket Sort	Ω(n+k)	θ(n+k)	O(n^2)
Radix Sort	Ω(nk)

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
